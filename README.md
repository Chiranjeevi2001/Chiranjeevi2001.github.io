### COBOL RuleForge
**Description:** Developed a framework for extraction and summarization of Business Rules from legacy COBOL codebases. Generated dataset of COBOL codes and corresponding business rules using few-shot prompting with Google‚Äôs `gemini-1.0-pro` model. Fine-tuned LLMs like Gemma, Llama2, and Mistral on the generated dataset, enhancing the accuracy and quality
of the extracted business rules compared to their non-fine-tuned versions <br>

**Technologies Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Google-Generative AI, Prompt Engineering, Fine-tuning<br>

### Susceptibility of Adversarial Attacks on Medical Image Segmentation Models
**Description:** Led an investigative study into the vulnerability of popular medical image segmentation models to white box adversarial attacks like FGSM. Utilized advanced deep learning techniques to assess the robustness of segmentation algorithms against targeted adversarial manipulation. Expanded upon the existing framework by conducting experiments and investigating potential vulnerabilities using an alternative neural network architecture, increasing the attack success rate by almost 6%. <br>

**Technologies Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, PyTorch, PIL, Autoencoders, UNET<br>
